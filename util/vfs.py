"""Virtual filesystem to prevent infinite sphinx rebuild loops.

TL;DR: Fix bad Sphinx cache busts by only writing when data would change

The helpers in this module aggregate writes to virtual files. When a
sync to disk is requested, the on-disk contents of each path are read
before writing. If the written data would be identical to the current
contents, the write operation is skipped for that file.

Normally, any change to project .rst files triggers the sphinx-autobuild
used in Arcade's ./make.py serve command. However, Arcade's doc build
generates .rst files for the items below:

* API pages
* resource listings
* A quick index file

This behavior predates our adoption of sphinx-autobuild. Since writing
is the trigger condition instead of content change, it can trigger an
infinite loop as follows:

1. Sphinx runs our auto-generation scripts
2. sphinx-autobuild detects the modification to the files
3. The process repeats infinitely

We can prevent this loop by limiting writes. This module achieves this
by reading each file before write and aborting if its contents would be
unchanged.
