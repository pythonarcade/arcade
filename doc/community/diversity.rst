Diverse Coders
==============

If you are female, trans, non-binary, POC there are a lot of coders like
you! But sometimes it can be hard to find them.

* `Python Software Foundation Diversity Statement <https://www.python.org/psf/diversity/>`_
* `PyCon 2022 Diversity Statement <https://us.pycon.org/2022/about/diversity/>`_
* `Arcade Library's Code of Conduct <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_

Check out the following organizations.

* `PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_
* `Django Girls <https://djangogirls.org/>`_
* `Girls Who Code <https://girlswhocode.com/>`_
* `Trans Game Dev <https://www.transgamedev.com/>`_

The US PyCon works hard to be open to create an inclusive conference.
I highly recommend it to people who are interested in going.
They have special sessions on diversity, easily identified
staff trained in incident response,
ribbons people put no their name tag for preferred pronouns,
and more.
PyLadies holds charity auctions at the US PyCon every year, raising over $20,000
every year to help support and promote coding amongst women.

If you are interested in getting started coding, or contributing to the Python
community, reach out to me or any of the organizations above.
