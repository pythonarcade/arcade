Community Locations
===================

Most of the community interaction happens on the  `Arcade Discord`_ and `Arcade Github`_.
The discord server is the best place to ask questions and get help.
We have help channels, various topic channels, and a place to share
your projects. This is also where most of the development discussion
happens.

Less active places (as of Summer 2024):

* `Reddit`_
* `Twitter`_

Note that these communities have people of all ages from all around the
world. Please be respectful and kind to everyone. Assume good intentions
and be patient with people who are learning.
