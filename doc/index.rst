Arcade is an easy-to-learn Python library for 2D games. The friendly API
caters to both beginners and experts alike. Do you want to make something small,
or explore the full power of shaders?

It's up to you. What will you make?

Open Source, Libre Assets
-------------------------

Arcade is free to use, and that :ref:`includes commercial projects <faq_commercial>`.
We make sure licensing stays out of the way so you can of focus on really matters: creating.

* :ref:`permissive_mit` for library code
* :ref:`resources` hand-picked for quality and zero-strings licensing
* Remixing the :ref:`examples` and other code is highly encouraged

.. pending: post-3.0 cleanup.

Get Involved
------------

Arcade exists because volunteers choose to make it better. If you see
a bug or a typo, let us know at once the :ref:`community-locations`.
The following are especially active:

* The `Arcade Discord`_
* The `Arcade GitHub`_ repo

.. raw:: html

   <br/>

Testing and bug reports are crucial to making the library better,
especially when the team is working on new features. Arcade's powerful
OpenGL and `Shadertoy <https://www.shadertoy.com/>`_ features couldn't
exist without help and contributions from users like you.

We welcome your help. See :ref:`how-to-contribute` for more on how to
get started.


Documentation and Community
---------------------------

Arcade stays true to its roots in education by provoding
documentation for different learning styles and experience levels.

* The :ref:`main-page-tutorials` are guided introductions to new skills
* The :ref:`example-code` help tinkerers get started quickly
* The manual in the left-hand sidebar offers overviews of concepts and features

Finally, there is the API documentation. It comes in two forms:

* The :ref:`arcade-api` explores Arcade's layout and features
* The :ref:`quick_index` is a single-page search tool

.. raw:: html

   <br/>

All of these areas link to another w[hen it helps enhance user experience.
However, if you feel overwhelmed, you may want to get :ref:`get help <how-to-get-help>`.



.. pending: post-3.0 cleanup. This little linebreak keeps the hidden
