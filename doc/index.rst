Arcade is an easy-to-learn Python library for creating 2D video games. It is
ideal for people learning to program, or developers that want to code a 2D
game without learning a complex framework.

The library was originally designed to be used in an educational setting, but
it has evolved to be a powerful library for creating games. It is used in
education, prototyping, and game jams. Hobbyists wanting to create a game
quickly can benefit from the library's simple API.


Documentation

Arcade provides several forms of documentation depending on the learning style of the user.
For beginners to programming the arcade book is a great place to start. For those who prefer
to learn by examples the arcade examples are a great resource. We also have various tutorials
for specific topics. More advanced users may prefer the API reference.
