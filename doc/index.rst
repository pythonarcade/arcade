Arcade is an easy-to-learn Python library for creating 2D video games. It is
ideal for people learning to program, or developers that want to code a 2D
game without learning a complex framework.

The library was originally designed to be used in an educational setting, but
it has evolved to be a powerful library for creating games. It is used in
education, prototyping, and game jams. Hobbyists wanting to create a game
quickly can benefit from the library's simple API.
