The `Python Discord <https://pythondiscord.com/>`_ 2020 Game Jam finished on
April 26, 2020. Participants completed a game in one week. Twenty-three teams
completed games, all of which are on the `Game Jam 2020 GitHub <https://github.com/python-discord/game-jam-2020>`_.

We played the top 10 games on the `Game Jam live-stream <https://youtu.be/KkLXMvKfEgs>`_,
which is available for replay. The theme of this game jam was "Three of a Kind".

Here are the games that made it to the top 10 finalists.

3 Keys on the Run
-----------------

The winning team consisted of a single member, EmberDuck. 
He created a very polished game, focusing in on one core idea and just nailing it perfectly.
This is a game where the player controls 3 different characters which need to jump over obstacles.

Triple Blocks
-------------

Second place went to SansPapyrus683, Blue Bird, & SimplyNarwell.
They created a platformer game where the player controls 3 different slimes to get through 6
different levels. The slimes can either move together in a stack, or the player can split them
apart to control each of them one by one. The physics in this game was a nice addition and tied
the game together nicely. The graphics in this game were quite beautiful and the UI complemented
it well. Check out the

Triple Vision
-------------

Third place went to BrainDead, F4zi, & f1re. They created a dungeon-crawler type of game where
the player can switch between 3 different wizards, each having their own special abilities. 
The red wizard has great strength, while the green wizard has a lot of defense and the blue 
wizard is quick and fast. A unique and exceptional feature of this game was the backend server 
which allowed a player to register/login. Check out the
