Contributing To Arcade
======================

We would love to have you contribute to the project! There are several
ways that you can do so.

.. _contributing-bug-reports:

Detailed Bug Reports
--------------------
These are great when they have clear replication steps.

Whether it's on `GitHub <GitHub Issue List>` or the `Arcade Discord`_, the
idea's the same:

#. Note your :ref:`Python and Arcade versions <help-basic-environment-info>`
#. Try to figure out when and how to make the bug happen

   * This can be hard, and that's okay
   * If you can't put it into words, any of the follwoing can help!

     * Screenshots or recordings
     * Error traceback
     * Example code that makes the problem happen

#. Search the `GitHub Issue List`_ for anything similar

   * If it exists, comment
   * If not, post a new one
   * Don't worry too much about posting duplicates

How to contribute without coding
--------------------------------

* **Community** - Post your projects, code, screen-shots, and discuss the Arcade library on the `Python Arcade SubReddit`_.
* Try coding your own animations and games. Write down notes on anything that
  is difficult to implement or understand about the library.
* **Suggest improvements** - Post bugs and enhancement requests at the `Github Issue List`_.
