This tutorial shows how to use Python and the Arcade library to create a 2D platformer game.
You'll learn to work with Sprites and the `Tiled Map Editor`_ to create your own games.
You can add coins, ramps, moving platforms, enemies, and more.

.. _Tiled Map Editor: https://www.mapeditor.org/

At the end of each chapter of this tutorial you will find the full source code that chapter,
as well as a command to run that chapter directly. As long as you have Arcade installed the
commands will run the exact code for that chapter, so you can compare your game against the tutorial.
