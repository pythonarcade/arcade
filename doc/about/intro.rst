History
-------

The Python Arcade Library was created by Paul Vincent Craven. Paul was a professor
of Computer Science at Simpson College in Iowa. He created the library
to teach his students how to program games in Python. The first public pre-release
was in March 2016.

There is no question the focus of the library is on education. It's designed to
be easy to use and to teach programming concepts.

The library has grown since then and is now used by people all over the world.
The library is mostly used in schools and by hobbyists, but have also been used in
various other settings such as visualization, simulation and prototyping. As the
library grows it's starting to be used in more professional settings as well.
