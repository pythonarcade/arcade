Python Arcade was created by Paul V. Craven while teaching at Simpson College.

In addition to the primary documentation you are currently viewing, there are
further resources and affordances for academic users. These include:

* A `citation template`_ in Arcade's GitHub landing page
* An `Arcade book`_ by the framework's creator
* Many third-party libraries and tutorials

Version Considerations
----------------------

Educators may prefer Arcade ``2.6.X`` over ``3.0.0`` due to its mature
documentation.

The Companion Book
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arcade 2.6 has an instructor-designed `companion book <Arcade book>`_. Although
the documentation you're reading now also aims to be an all-ages document, it
lacks the translations and clear curriculum structure provided by the book. It
integrates these with crucial materials:

* embedded videos demonstrating both concepts and past student projects
* a gentle introduction to industry-standard tools which often intimidate CS graduates
* languages and CS topics applicable at the univerity level and beyond
