Frequently asked questions
==========================

.. _faq_education:

Can I use Arcade resources in my own educational materials?
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. _gh_license: https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/blob/development/license.rst

Yes! Arcade was originally developed for educational use. In addition to
a page :ref:`academia`, we have further documentation covering:


* The :ref:`permissive_mit` covers the library and documentation
* The :ref:`CC0 Public Domain Dedication <permissive_almost_all_public>` and similar cover the :ref:`resources`

.. _faq_commercial:

Can I use Arcade in a commercial project?
-----------------------------------------

:ref:`commercial_games`. There's already one commercially released game using Arcade.

.. _faq-copying:

Can I copy and adapt example code for my own projects?
------------------------------------------------------

Of course! We encourage you to do so. That's why the example code is there: we
want you to learn and be successful. See the :ref:`permissive_mit` section to learn
more about Arcade's license means (you agree not to claim you wrote the whole thing).

Can Arcade run on...?
---------------------

Yes: Windows, Mac, and Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most hardware with an Intel or AMD processor from the last ten years will do fine.
New :ref:`requirements_mac_mseries` can have some hiccups, but they generally work.

.. _faq-raspi:

Yes: Raspberry Pi 4 and 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following Raspberry Pi models are known to work under Linux:

* `Raspberry Pi 4 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/>`_
* `The Raspberry Pi 400 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/>`_ (Keyboard-embedded Pi 4)
* `The Raspberry Pi 5 <https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/>`_

Almost all features will work with the exception of advanced shaders. Similar SBCs may
also work. To learn more, please see :ref:`requirements_raspi`.

Web

Not yet. This may be possible in the future, but it will require a lot of work.

.. _faq_android:
.. _faq_ios:
.. _faq_ipad:

Android, iOS, or iPad
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sadly, not in the foreseeable future. Android is possible, but it will take a lot of work. iOS gets much trickier.
