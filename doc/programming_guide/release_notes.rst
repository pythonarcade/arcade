Release Notes
=============

Keep up-to-date with the latest changes to the Arcade library by the release notes.

Version 2.7.0
-------------

*Unreleased*

Version 2.7.0 is a major update to Arcade. It is not 100% compatible with the 2.6 API.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the API changes which could require updates to existing code based on the 2.6 API. Some of these things may
be repeated in the Updates section of these release notes, however we have compiled the breaking changes here for easy
easier reference. There may be other behavior changes that could break specific scenarios, but this section is limited
to changes which directly changed the API in a way that is not compatible with how it was used in 2.6.

* The ``update`` function has been removed from the :py:class:`~arcade.Window`, :py:class:`~arcade.View`,
  :py:class:`~arcade.Section`, and :py:class:`~arcade.Sectionmanager` classes in favor of the ``on_update()`` function. This function
  has been the recommended way to use Arcade for a long time now. It works the same as the ``update`` function
  however it is able to receive a ``delta_time`` parameter which is the time since the last update.
* The ``update_rate`` parameter of :py:class:`~arcade.Window` can no longer be set to ``None``. Previously it defaulted
  to ``1 / 60`` however could be set to ``None``. The default is still the same, but setting it to None will not do anything.
* Sprites created from the :py:class:`~arcade.TileMap` class would previously set a key in the ``Sprite.properties`` dictionary
  named ``type``. This key has been renamed to ``class``. This is in keeping with Tiled's renaming of the key and following the Tiled
  format/API as closely as possible.
* The ``arcade.text_pillow`` and ``arcade.text_pyglet`` modules have been completely removed. The pillow implementation is gone, and the
  pyglet one has been renamed to just ``arcade.text``. These modules were largely internal, but it is possible to have referenced them directly.
* Due to the above change and removal of the pillow text implementation, the :py:func:`~arcade.create_text_sprite` previously referred to
  the Pillow text implementation, and there was no easy way to create a sprite from Text with the pyglet implementation. This function has
  been re-worked to use the pyglet based text system. It has no API breaking changes, but the underlying functionality has changed a lot, so
  if you are using this function it may be worth checking the docs for it again. The main concern for a difference here would be if you
  are also using any custom :py:class:`~arcade.TextureAtlas`.

Featured Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Arcade now supports OpenGL ES 3.1/3.2 and have been
  tested on the Raspberry Pi 4. Any model using the Cortex-A72
  CPU should work. Note that you need fairly new Mesa drivers
  to get the new V3D drivers.
* Rotation order changed to clockwise
* Arcade now supports mixing pyglet and arcade drawing meaning
  you can for example use pyglet batches, which can draw thousands
  and thousands of pyglet objects with the cost and performance time
  of only a few.
* Added a new system for handling background textures (ADD MORE INFO)

Changes
~~~~~~~

* :py:class:`~arcade.Window`

  * Removal of the ``update`` function in favor of :py:meth:`~arcade.Window.on_update()`
  * ``update_rate`` parameter in the constructor can no longer be set to ``None``. Must be a float.
  * Added ``draw_rate`` parameter to constructor, this will control the interval that the :py:meth:`~arcade.Window.on_draw()`
    function is called at. This can be used with the pre-existing ``update_rate`` parameter which controls
    :py:meth:`~arcade.Window.on_update()` to achieve separate draw and update rates.

* :py:class:`~arcade.View`

  * Removal of the ``update`` function in favor of :py:meth:`~arcade.View.on_update()`

* :py:class:`~arcade.Section` and :py:class:`~arcade.Sectionmanager`

  * Removal of the ``update`` function in favor of ``on_update()``

* GUI

  * :py:class:`~arcade.gui.widgets.UIWidget`

    * supports padding, border and background (color and texture)
    * Visibility: visible=False will prevent rendering of the widget. It will also not receive any ui events
    * Dropped :py:meth:`~arcade.gui.widget.UIWidget.with_space_around()`
    * ``UIWidget.with_`` methods do not wrap the widget anymore, they only change the attributes
    * Fixed an blending issue when rendering the gui surface to the screen

  * New widgets:

    * :py:class:`~arcade.gui.widgets.dropdown.UIDropdown`
    * :py:class:`~arcade.gui.widgets.slider.UISlider`

  * Arcade :py:class:`~arcade.gui.property.Property`:

    Properties are observable attributes (supported: primitive, list and dict). Listener can be bound with :py:meth:`~arcade.gui.property.bind`

  * Misc Changes

    * arcade.color_from_hex_string changed to follow the CSS hex string standard
    * Windows Text glyph are now created with DirectWrite instead of GDI
    * Removal of various deprecated functions and parameters
    * OpenGL examples moved to ``examples/gl`` from ``experiments/examples``

* Text

  * Complete removal of the old PIL based text system. In Arcade 2.6 we had largely switched to the newer Pyglet based system, however
    there were still remnants of the PIL implementation around. Namely the :py:func:`~arcade.create_text_sprite` function which has been
    updated to use the Pyglet system. There's no API breaking change here but if you are using the function it would be worth reading the
    new docs for it, as there are some different considerations surrounding use of a custom :py:class:`~arcade.TextureAtlas` if you are also
    doing that. This function should now be much much faster than the old PIL implementation. The texture generation happens almost entirely on
    the GPU now.
  * As part of this move, the ``arcade.text_pillow`` module has been removed completely, and the ``arcade.text_pyglet`` module has been re-named
    just be ``arcade.text``.

* OpenGL

  * Support for OpenGL ES 3.1 and 3.2. 3.2 is fully supported, 3.1 is only supported if the ``EXT_geometry_shader`` extension
    is provided by the driver. This is part of the minimum spec in 3.2 so it is guaranteed to be there. This is the only optional
    extension that Arcade needs to function with 3.1.

    As an example, the Raspberry Pi 4b only supports OpenGL ES 3.1, however does provide this extension, so is fully compatible
    with Arcade.
  * Textures now support immutable storage
  * Arcade is now using pyglet's projection and view matrix.
    All functions setting matrixes will update the pyglet window's
    ``view`` and ``projection`` attributes. Arcade shaders is also
    using pyglet's ``WindowBlock`` UBO.
  * Uniforms are now set using ``glProgramUniform`` instead of ``glUniform``
    when the extension is available.
  * Fixed many implicit type conversions in the shader code for wider support.

* :py:class:`~arcade.TileMap`

  * Added support Tiles defined as a sub-rectangle of an image. See Tiled 1.9 Release notes for more information on this feature.
  * Changed the ``Sprite.properties`` key "type" to "class" to stay in line with Tiled's re-naming of this key in their API.
  * You can now define a custom texture atlas for SpriteLists created in a TileMap. You can provide a map default to the ``texture_atlas``
    parameter of the :py:class:`~arcade.Tilemap` class or the :py:func:`~arcade.load_tilemap` function. This will be used by default on all
    layers, however it can be overridden on a per-layer basis as defined by the new ``texture_atlas`` key in the ``layer_options`` dictionary.
    If no custom atlas is provided, then the global default atlas will be used(This is how it works pre Arcade 2.7).

* Fix API colors for Furo theme

Version 2.6.14
--------------

*Released 2022-May-18*

* Various Improvements

  * Allow specifying hit box parameters in :py:func:`~arcade.load_textures` and
    :py:func:`~arcade.load_spritesheet`
  * :py:class:`~arcade.Camera` should no longer apply zoom on the z axis
  * Promote using :py:meth:`arcade.View.on_show_view` in examples
    and tutorials
  * The arcade window and views now expose :py:meth:`arcade.Window.on_enter`
    :py:meth:`arcade.Window.on_leave`. These events are triggered
    when the mouse enters and leaves the window area.
  * Sections should now also support mouse enter/leave events
  * Hit box calculation methods should raise a more useful
    error message when the texture is not RGBA.
  * Slight optimization in updating sprite location in SpriteList
  * Removed all remaining references to texture transforms
  * Removed the broken ``Sprite.__lt__`` method
  * Added :py:func:`~arcade.get_angle_radians`
  * Removed ``Texture.draw_transformed``
  * Add support for changing the pitch while playing a sound. See the `speed` parameter in
    :py:func:`arcade.play_sound`.
  * Set better blending defaults for arcade GUI
  * Can now create a texture filled with a single color. See :py:meth:`Texture.create_filled`.
    The Sprite class will use this when creating a solid colored sprite.
  * Bump version numbers of Sphinx, Pillow to current release as of 17-May.
  * Bump Pyglet version to 2.0.dev16. (Thanks Pyglet!)

* Shadertoy

  * Added ``Shadertoy.delta_time`` alias for ``time_delta`` (``iTimeDelta``)
  * Support the ``iFrame`` uniform. Set frame using the
    :py:attr:`arcade.experimental.ShadertoyBase.frame` attribute
  * Support the ``iChannelTime`` uniform. Set time for each individual channel using
    the :py:attr:`arcade.experimental.ShadertoyBase.channel_time` attribute.
  * Support the ``iFrameRate`` uniform. Set frame rate using the
    :py:attr:`arcade.experimental.ShadertoyBase.frame_rate` attribute
  * Support the ``iDate`` uniform. This uniform will be automatically
    set. See :py:meth:`arcade.experimental.ShadertoyBase._get_date`
  * Support the ``iChannelResolution`` uniform. This uniform will be automatically set
  * Added example using video with shadertoy
  * Improve Shadertoy docstrings + unit tests

* Docs / Tutorials / Examples

  * Updated install docs
  * Added tutorial for compiling an arcade game with Nuika
  * Improved/extended shadertoy tutorials
  * Added example using textures with shadertoy
  * Added sprite rotation examples
  * Clarified the difference between :py:meth:`arcade.View.on_show_view`
    and :py:meth:`arcade.View.on_show`
  * Improved UIManager docstrings
  * Various annotation and docstring improvements
  * Fixed several broken links in docs
  * We're now building PDF/EPUB docs

* OpenGL

  * Added new method for safely setting shader program uniforms: 
    :py:meth:`arcade.gl.Program.set_uniform_safe`. This method will
    ignore ``KeyError`` if the uniform doesn't exist. This is
    often practical during development because most GLSL compilers/linkers
    will remove uniforms that is determined to not affect the outcome
    of a shader.
  * Added new method for safely setting a uniform array:
    :py:meth:`arcade.gl.Program.set_uniform_array_safe`.
    This is practical during development because uniform arrays
    are in most cases shortened by GLSL compiler if not all
    array indices are used by the shader.
  * Added :py:attr:`arcade.gl.Texture.swizzle`. This can be used
    to reorder how components are read from the texture by a shader
    making it easy to crate simple effects or automatically
    convert BGR pixel formats to RGB when needed.
  * Added ray marching example with fragment shader
  * Allow reading framebuffer data with 2 and 4 byte component sizes
  * Simplified texture atlas texture coordinates to make them
    easier to use in custom shaders.
  * Support dumping the atlas texture as RGB
  * Support dumping the atlas texture with debug lines
    showing texture borders
  * We no longer check ``GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK`` due to
    missing support in older drivers. Especially GL 3.1 drivers
    that can in theory run arcade
  * Various shader cleanups

* Experimental

  * Added a simple profiler class

Version 2.6.13
--------------

*Released 2022-Mar-25*

* New Features

  * Arcade can now run in headless mode on linux servers opening
    more possibilities for users in for example the data science
    community (`#1107 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1107>`_).
    See :ref:`headless` for more information.

* Bugfixes

  * The random text glitching issue especially affecting users with iGPUs
    is finally resolved in pyglet. For that reason we have upgraded to
    the pyglet 2.0a2 release.
  * Fixed an issue causing :py:func:`arcade.draw_circle_filled` and
    :py:func:`arcade.draw_circle_outline` to always render with 3 segments
    on some iGPUs.
  * Fixed an issue causing interactive widgets to unnecessarily re-draw when
    hovering or pressing them. This could cause performance issues.
  * SectionManager's ``on_show_view`` was never called when showing a view

* Various Improvements

  * :py:func:`arcade.load_font` now supports resource handles
  * :py:class:`~arcade.PhysicsEngineSimple` can now take an iterable of wall spritelists
  * Sprite creation is now ~6-8% faster.
  * Removed warning about missing shapely on startup
  * Window titles are now optional. If no window title is specified
    the title will be the absolute path to the python file it was created in.
    This was changed because of the new headless mode.
  * Removed ``arcade.quick_run``. This function had no useful purpose.
  * Added clear method to UIManager (`#1116 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1116>`_)
  * Updated from Pillow 9.0.0 to 9.0.1

* Tilemap

  * Rectangle objects which are empty(have no width or height) will now be automatically
    converted into single points.
  * The Tile ID of a sprite can be access with ``sprite.properties["tile_id"]``. This refers
    to the local ID of the tile within the Tileset. This value can be used to get the tile info
    for a given Sprite created from loading a tilemap.

* Docs

  * Added python version support info to install instructions (`#1122 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1122>`_)
  * Fixed typo in :py:func:`~arcade.Sprite.append_texture` docstring(`#1126 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1126>`_)
  * Improved the raycasting tutorial (`#1124 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1124>`_)
  * Replace mentions of 3.6 on Linux install page (`#1129 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1129>`_)
  * Fix broken links in the homepage (`#1139 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/pull/1130>`_)
  * Lots of other improvements to docstrings throughout the code base
  * General documentation improvements

* OpenGL

  * :py:class:`arcade.gl.Geometry` now supports transforming to multiple buffers.
  * Added and improved examples in ``experimental/examples``.
  * Major improvements to API docs

Version 2.6.12
--------------

*Released 2022-Mar-20*

* General:

  * Bugfix: :py:func:`~arcade.check_for_collision_with_list` selected
    the wrong collision algorithm. This could affect performance.
  * Bugfix: GPU collision detection show now work on older MacBooks
  * Added :py:meth:`arcade.Text.draw_debug` that will visualize
    the content area of the text and the anchor point. This
    can be useful to understand the text anchoring.
  * :py:class:`arcade.Text` now has a ``left``, ``right`` ``top``
    and ``bottom`` attribute for getting the pixel locations
    of the content borders.
  * Added performance warning for :py:func:`arcade.draw_text`.
    Using :py:class:`arcade.Text` is a lot faster. We have
    also promoted the use of text objects in examples.
  * Removed the deprecated ``arcade.create_text`` function
  * ``UITextureButton.texture_pressed`` now returns the pressed texture,
    not the texture

* Documentation

  * Work on :ref:`shader_toy_tutorial_glow`.
  * Docstring improvements throughout the code base
  * Many examples are cleaned up

* OpenGL

  * :py:class:`arcade.gl.Buffer` is guaranteed to contain
    zero byte values on creation.
  * Expose :py:class:`~arcade.gl.context.Limits` in :py:attr:`arcade.gl.Context.info`
    and document all limit values
  * Added limit: ``MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS``
  * :py:meth:`arcade.gl.Buffer.read` now reads the correct
    number of bytes when only ``offset`` parameter is passed.
  * Improved compute shader examples
  * Support uniform blocks in compute shaders
  * Bug: :py:attr:`arcade.gl.Context.enabled` now properly
    reverts to the original context flags
  * Many docstring improvements in the ``arcade.gl`` module
  * Bugfix: Query objects ignored creation parameters
  * :py:class:`arcade.gl.ComputeShader` is now part of the gl module
  * :py:class:`arcade.gl.ComputeShader` was added to docs
  * Expose and document :py:class:`arcade.gl.context.ContextStats`

Version 2.6.11
--------------

*Released 2022-Mar-17*

* Sections - Add support to divide window into sections.
  (Thanks `janscas <https://github.com/janscas>`_ for the contribution.)

  * Add :class:`arcade.Section` to the API.
  * Add :class:`arcade.SectionManager` to the API.
  * Add examples on how to use: :ref:`section_examples`

* New Example Code:

  * Add parallax example: :ref:`parallax`.
  * Add GUI flat button styling example: :ref:`gui_flat_button_styled`.
  * Add :ref:`perspective` example.

* New functionality:

  * Add :func:`arcade.get_angle_degrees` function.
  * Add easing functions and example. See :ref:`easing_example_1` and :ref:`easing_example_2`.
  * Add :meth:`arcade.Sprite.facePoint` to face sprite towards a point.

* Fixes:

  * Fixed issue `#1074 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1074>`_
    to prevent a crash when opening a window.
  * Fixed issue `#978 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/978>`_,
    copy button in examples moved to the left to prevent it disappearing.
  * Fixed issue `#967 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/967>`_,
    CRT example now pulls from resources so people don't have to download image to try it out.
  * PyMunk sample map now in resources so people don't have to download it.
  * :func:`arcade.draw_points` no longer draws the points twice, improving performance.

* Documentation:

  * Update :ref:`pygame-comparison`.
  * Improve ``Sprite.texture`` docs.
  * When building Arcade docs, script now lets us know what classes don't have docstrings.
  * Spelling/typo fixes in docs.

* Misc:

  * Update :class:`arcade.Sprite` to use decorators to declare properties instead of the older method.
  * `#1095 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1095>`_,
    Improvements to :class:`arcade.Text` and its documentation.
    We can now also get the pixel size of a Text contents though ``content_width``,
    ``content_height`` and ``content_size``.
  * Force GDI text on windows until direct write is more mature.
  * Optimized text rendering and text rotation
  * :py:func:`arcade.draw_text` and :py:class:`arcade.Text` objects
    now accepts any python object as text and converts it into
    a string internally if needed.
  * :py:class:`~arcade.SpriteList` now exposes several new members
    that used to be private. These are lower level members related
    to the underlying geometry of the spritelist and can be used
    by custom shaders to do interesting things blazingly fast.
    SpriteList interaction example with shaders can be found in the
    experimental directory.
    Members include :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.write_sprite_buffers_to_gpu`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.geometry`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_positions`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_sizes`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_textures`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_colors`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_angles` and
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.buffer_indices`

* OpenGL:

  * Added support for indirect rendering. This is an OpenGL 4.3 feature.
    It makes us able to render multiple meshes in the the same draw call
    providing significant speed increases in some use cases.
    See :py:meth:`arcade.gl.Geometry.render_indirect` and examples
    in the experimental directory.
  * Added support for unsigned integer uniform types
  * ``arcade.gl.Geometry.transform`` no longer takes a mode parameter.

Version 2.6.10
--------------

*Released 2022-Jan-29*

* Sprites

  * Collision checking against one or more sprite lists
    can use the GPU via a 'transform' for much better performance.
    The :meth:`arcade.check_for_collision_with_list` and :meth:`arcade.check_for_collision_with_lists`
    methods now support selection between spatial, GPU, and CPU methods of detection.
  * Added :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.clear` for resetting/clearing a spritelist. This will iterate
    and remove all sprites by default, or do a faster `O(1)` clear. Please read the api docs
    to find out what version fits your use case.
  * :py:class:`~arcade.SpriteList` now supports setting a global color and alpha value.
    The new :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.color`, :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.color_normalized`,
    :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.alpha` and :py:attr:`~arcade.SpriteList.alpha_normalized`
    will affect every sprite in the list. This global color value is multiplied by the
    individual sprite colors. 
  * The :py:class:`~arcade.Sprite` initializer now also accepts ``None`` value for ``hit_box_algorithm``
    in line with the underlying texture method.
  * Fixed a bug causing sprites to have incorrect scale when passing a texture
    during creation.
  * Removed the texture transform feature in sprites. This feature no longer
    makes sense since arcade 2.6.0 due to the new texture atlas feature.

* Tiled Maps

  * Fixed issue `#1068 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1068>`_
    (#1069) where loaded rectangular hit box was wrong.
  * Add better error for infinite tile maps
  * Added ``SpriteList.properties`` and properties from Image and Tile layers will automatically be
    loaded into that when loading a Tiled map

* General

  * ``Window.current_camera`` will now hold a reference to the currently active camera.
    This will be set when calling :py:meth:`arcade.Camera.use`, if no camera is active
    then it will be ``None``.
  * ``Window.clear`` can now clear a sub-section of the screen through
    the new optional ``viewport`` parameter.
  * :py:meth:`arcade.Window.clear` can now take normalized/float color values
  * The new :py:meth:`arcade.View.clear` method now clears the current window. This can
    be used as a shortcut :py:meth:`arcade.Window.clear` when inside of a View class.
  * Add support for custom resource handles
  * Add support for anisotropic filtering with textures.
  * Clearing the window should always clear the entire window
    regardless of camera / viewport setup (unless a scissor box is set)

* Documentation

  * Change examples so instead of ``arcade.start_render()`` we use ``self.clear()``.
    The start render function was confusing people.
    `#1071 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1071>`_
  * Fix a bunch of links that were incorrectly pointing to old pvcraven instead of pythonarcade.
    `#1063 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1063>`_
  * Update pyinstaller instructions
  * Various documentation improvements and updates

* ``arcade.gl``

  * Fixed a bug were out attributes in transforms was not properly detected
    with geometry shaders
  * Fixed a bug were specifying vertex count wasn't possible with transforms when
    the vertex array has an index buffer bound.
  * The :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Query` object now allows for selecting what specific queries should be performed
  * Fixed a issue causing the wrong garbage collection mode to activate during context creation
  * Viewport values for the default framebuffer now applies pixel ratio by default
  * Scissor values for the default framebuffer now applies pixel ratio by default

* ``arcade.gui``

  * :py:class:`~arcade.gui.UIBoxLayout` supports now align in constructor (changing later requires a `UIBoxLayout.trigger_full_render()`).
  * :py:class:`~arcade.gui.UIBoxLayout` supports now space_between in constructor.

Version 2.6.9
-------------

*Released on 2022-Jan-13*

* Bump version of Pillow from 8.4 to 9.0.0 due to security vulnerability in Pillow.

Version 2.6.8
-------------

*Released on 2021-Dec-25*

* The `Shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library is now optional.
  The shapely library uses native code to make operations
  such as collision detection and some other geometry operations faster. However they have not
  updated their binaries to support Python 3.10 on macOS and Windows. If Shapely is installed,
  Arcade will use that library. Otherwise it will fall back to slower, but Python-only code.
  See: https://github.com/shapely/shapely/issues/1215
* :class:`~arcade.TileMap` changes:

  There are no API changes to the TileMap class, however full support for TMX maps, TSX tilesets, and TX object templates
  has been added thanks to pytiled-parser 2.0. You should be able to load these formats with 0 change to your code, and use
  all the same features that were available with JSON maps.

  This update also includes the ability to cross-load JSON and TMX maps/tilesets. Meaning you can have a JSON map load a TSX tileset,
  or have a TMX map load a JSON tileset.

  You don't ever need to explicitly set or configure a format to use, it will be automatically determined based on the file you pass
  in. It is determined based on the actual content of the file, and not the filetype, so if you give it a ``.json`` file that actually
  contains TMX, or vice versa, it will still work without problem.

* Update `Pyglet`_ to 2.0.dev13 which fixes a bug where  ``on_resize`` wasn't getting called.
* Added a `compute shader tutorial <https://api.arcade.academy/en/development/tutorials/compute_shader/index.html>`_.

Version 2.6.7
-------------

*Released on 2021-Dec-15*

* This version updates Pyglet to 2.0dev12. Programs WILL NOT RUN with prior versions of Pyglet.

* :class:`~arcade.Window` changes:

  * Added ``enable_polling`` option to constructor. If enabled then ``window.keyboard`` and ``window.mouse``
    will be activated and able to be used to poll input by accessing them as if they were a dictionary.
    This option is enabled by default. See  `#1038 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1038>`_
    
    ``window.keyboard`` can be polled using the values from ``arcade.key``.

    ``window.mouse`` can be polled using the following values:

      * 1: Left click
      * 2: Right click
      * 3: Middle click
      * "x": X position
      * "y": Y position

* :class:`~arcade.Camera` changes:

  * Defaults the viewport width and height to the window size if they are set to 0 now, since you cannot have
    a size of 0 in any direction due to projection calculation. This means that if you do not provide those arguments
    to the constructor it will default to the window size. See  `#1041 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1041>`_

* :class:`~arcade.tilemap.TileMap` changes:

  * Added support for layer position offsets. This allows passing a tuple containing an X and Y offset that will be applied to
    each Sprite/Object within the layer. You can set this via an ``offset`` parameter in the ``layer_options`` dict, or you can
    supply a global offset to the map which will be applied to all layers via the ``offset`` parameter of either ``arcade.load_tilemap``
    or to the TileMap constructor directly. Layer specific offsets will override the global default if both are set.
    See  `#1048 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1048>`_

  * Added a new error message for JSONDecodeError exceptions, a common problem when tilesets are TSX but maps are JSON.
    This change simply provides a more clear error of the most likely cause of the problem so users don't have to dig as much.

* Text

  * Reverted the extra guards around text rendering that was implemented in 2.6.6. This turned out to cause slowdowns where
    text was being used heavily. Work is still ongoing to fix the remaining issues with text.

* Docs Fixes:

  * See  `#1033 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1033>`_ and  `#1046 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1046>`_
  * `#1043 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/1043>`_ Update moving platforms example.

Version 2.6.6
-------------

*Released on 2021-Dec-04*

* :class:`~arcade.TileMap` changes:

  * Added ``tiled_map`` parameter to init function of TileMap class. It allows to pass an already parsed map from 
    from pytiled-parser to it. Previously it could only be used with raw files and would handle the parsing automatically.
    If a pre-parsed map is passed to this, the ``map_file`` parameter will simply be ignored. This addition makes working
    with pre-parsed maps from a World file possible.

* Text

  * Added extra guards around text rendering calls to hopefully reduce
    glitchy text rendering. Work is still ongoing to fix the remaining issues with text.

* Window:
  
  * Added ``samples`` parameter so user can specify antialiasing quality.
  * The arcade window should fall back to no antialiasing if the window
    creation fails. Some drivers/hardware don't support it. For example
    when running arcade in WSL or services like Repl.it.

* SpriteList

  * Optimization: Empty spritelists created before the window or created with ``lazy=True``
    no longer automatically initialize internal OpenGL resources for empty
    spritelists and will instead immediately leave the ``draw()`` method.

* UI

  * Add experimental UI styles dataclasses for UIWidget styling.
  * Add UISlider, which provides a general slider element with some basic functionality
  * Fix UIInputText rendering

* Sound

  * Pyglet audio drivers can now be overridden using the ``ARCADE_SOUND_BACKENDS``
    environment variable for debug purposes. It expects a comma separated string
    with driver names.

* OpenGL

  * From version 2.6.6 Arcade is no longer using the ``auto`` garbage collection
    mode for OpenGL resources. This mode has the same behavior as the Python
    garbage collection. Instead we're now using the ``context_gc`` mode were
    resources are released every time ``Window.flip()`` is called (every frame by default).
    This solves many problems such as threads in your project or external libraries
    suddenly trying to garbage collect OpenGL objects while this is only possible
    in the main thread. This should not cause any problems for most users.
  * Added ``Context.copy_framebuffer``. This can be used to copy framebuffers
    with or without multisampling to another framebuffer. This makes us able
    to do offscreen rendering with multisampling.
  * ``Texture`` s can now be created with multisampling by passing the ``samples``
    parameter. This should only be used for attachments to framebuffers.
    The ``Texture`` object now also has a ``samples`` property (read only).

* Examples

  * Update mini-map example
  * Update scrolling camera example
  * Update google analytics code in docs
  * Remove some less-than-useful examples in the example code section
  * Update platformer example
  * Update windows install instructions
  * Update sample games to show more sample games
  * Improve CRT filter tutorial
  * New example code on how to follow a path
  * Added Game of Life example using shaders

* Documentation

  * Added API docs for ``arcade.gl``
  * ``ArcadeContext`` should now show inherited members
  * Edge artifact page now encourage using ``pixelated`` argument instead of importing
    OpenGL enums from pyglet

Version 2.6.5
-------------

*Released on 2021-Nov-5*

* Increased pyglet's default atlas size for text glyphs to remove text
  flickering and various other artifacts. This issue will be fixed
  in future versions of pyglet.
* Fixed as issue causing all sprites to use the same texture on some Macs.
* Improved doc for setting the viewport.

Special thanks to

`pushfoo <https://github.com/pushfoo>`_,
for their contributions to this release.

Version 2.6.4
-------------

*Released on 2021-Nov-3*

* Python 3.10 updates. Dependent library versions have been updated to
  include Python 3.10 support. All libraries appear to support 3.10 except
  Shapely 1.8.0 on the Windows platform. Until those binaries are released,
  3.10 support for Windows is still not there.
* :class:`~arcade.SpriteList` additions:

  * A ``visible`` attribute has been added to this class. If set to ``False``, when calling ``draw()`` on the SpriteList it
    will simply return and do nothing. Causing the SpriteList to not be drawn. 
  * SpriteList now has a ``lazy`` (bool) parameter causing it to not create internal OpenGL resources
    until the first draw call or until SpriteList's :meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.initialize` is called. This means that
    sprite lists and sprites can now be created in threads.
  * Fixes/optimized :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.reverse` and :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.shuffle` methods.
  * Added :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.sort` method. This is identical to Python's ``list.sort``
    but are many times faster sorting your sprites.
  * Removed noisy warning message when spritelists were created before the window
  * Fixed an issue with :py:meth:`~arcade.SpriteList.insert` when trying to insert sprites past
    an index greater than the current length. It could cause inserted sprites to be invisible.

* :class:`~arcade.Sprite` changes:

  * Added :py:attr:`arcade.Sprite.visible` property for quickly making sprites visible/invisible. This is simply
    a shortcut for changing the alpha value.
  * Optimization: Sprites should now take ~15% less memory and be ~15% faster to create
  * :py:class:`~arcade.SpriteCircle` and :py:class:`SpriteSolidColor` textures are now cached internally
    for better performance.

* :class:`~arcade.PhysicsEnginePlatformer` Optimization:

  A ``walls`` parameter has been added to this class. The new intention for usage of this class is for static(non-moving)
  sprites to be sent to the ``walls`` parameter, while moving platforms should be sent to the ``platforms`` parameter. Properly
  differentiating between these parameters can result in extreme performance benefits. Sprites added to ``platforms`` are
  O(n) whereas Sprites added to ``walls`` are O(1). This has been tested with anywhere from 100 to 500k+ Sprites, and the
  physics engine shows no measurable difference between those scenarios.

  We have also removed the ability to send a single Sprite to the ``platforms``, ``ladders``, and ``walls`` parameters of this class.
  This is a use case which results in some improper usage and unnecessary slowdowns. These parameters will now only accept SpriteLists
  or an iterable such as a list containing SpriteLists. If you are currently using this functionality, you just need to add your Sprite
  to a SpriteList and provide that instead.

  The simple platformer tutorial has already been updated to make use of this optimization.

* :class:`~arcade.Scene` is additions:

  * The Scene class is now sub-scriptable, previously in order to retrieve a SpriteList from Scene, you needed to use
    either ``Scene.name_mapping`` or ``Scene.get_sprite_list``.
    We have now added the ability to access it by sub-scripting the Scene object directly, like
    ``spritelist = my_scene["My Layer"]``
  * Added ``on_update()`` method. Previously Scene only had ``update()``. Both of these methods simply call the
    corresponding one on each SpriteList, however previously you could not
    do this with ``on_update()``. The difference between these methods is that ``on_update()`` allows passing a delta
    time, whereas ``update()`` does not.

* :class:`~arcade.TileMap` additions and fixes:

  * When loading a Tiled map Arcade will now respect if layers are visible or not. If a layer is not visible in Tiled,
    the SpriteList
    created for it will use the new ``visible`` attribute to control it. This means that when creating a Scene from a
    TileMap, this will
    automatically be respected as well.
  * Fixed support for parallax values on layers. Currently there is no support to do anything with these out of the box,
    you'd need to manually
    pull the values and do something based on them, however previously the map would not load if the values were changed
    from the default. This has
    been fixed in pytiled-parser and we have updated our version in Arcade accordingly.
  * Removed a lingering debug tactic of printing the class name of custom SpriteList classes when loading a TileMap.

* UI

  * :class:`~arcade.UIInputText` now supports both RGB and RGBA text color

* Text
  
  * Several text related bugs have been resolved in pyglet, the underlying library
    we now use for text drawing. This has been a fairly time consuming task
    over several weeks and we hope the new pyglet based text system will stabilize from now on.
    Arcade is an early adopter of pyglet 2.0 currently using a pre-release
  * The :py:class:`~arcade.Text` object is now usable and is preferred over
    :py:func:`arcade.draw_text` in many cases for performance reasons.
  * Text related functions should now have better documentation

* Misc:

  * Added support to the :class:`~arcade.View` class for :meth:`~arcade.View.on_resize`
  * Many docstring improvements. Initializer docstrings have now been moved to the class
    docstring ensuring they will always show up in the generated api docs.
  * Added some new sections under advanced docs related to OpenGL, textures and texture atlas
  * New utility function :func:`~arcade.color_from_hex_string` that will turn a hex string into a color.
  * Bug: Removed a lingering debug key ``F12`` that showed the contents of the global texture atlas
  * Several improvements to typing and PEP-8. Plus automated tests to help keep things
    in good shape.
  * Added ``run()`` shortcut in ``arcade.Window``. Usage: ``MyWindow().run()``
  * Addition of :class:`~arcade.PymunkException` class for throwing Pymunk errors in the
    Pymunk physics engine.
  * The :func:`~arcade.check_for_collision_with_lists` function will now accept any Iterable(List, Tuple, Set, etc) containing SpriteLists.

* Lower level rendering API:

  * Fixed a problem causing Geometry / VertexArray to ignore ``POINTS`` primitive mode when this is set as default.
  * Added support for compute shaders. We support writing to textures and SSBOs (buffers).
    Examples can be found in ``arcade/experimental/examples``
  * Fixed a crash when drawing with geometry shaders due to referencing a non-existent enum

Version 2.6.3
-------------

*Released on 2021-Sept-21*

* Bug fix, use a signed in as the 'killed' index. `#965 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/965>`_
* Fix dead links on getting started page See `#960 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/960>`_
* Fix some doc language that mixed function/method vocabulary. See `#963 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/963>`_
* Some initial work on compute and camera shader work. Not done yet.
* Fixed a bug causing the sprite geometry shader to not compile in some platforms
* Fixed a bug related to texture bleeding with sprites. Texture atlases now

* ``SpriteList.draw``: The arguments are now better exposed in docs
* ``Sprite.draw`` now has the same blending and interpolation argument as ``SpriteList.draw``
* Upgraded to pyglet 2.0dev9

Version 2.6.2
-------------

*Released on 2021-Sept-18*

* Support for custom classes that subclass Sprite for tiles in TileMap objects. See `#942 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/942>`_
* Update PymunkPhysicsEngine to work with any direction of gravity rather than just downward. See `#940 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/940>`_
* Update library versions we depend on. PIL, Pymunk, etc.
* Fix the card game example code. See `#951 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/951>`_
* Fix for drawing small circles not using enough segments. See `#950 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/950>`_
* A lot of documentation links in the .py files were old and not updated to the RTD way, fixed now.
* ``arcade.key`` was missing from the documentation quick index. Fixed.
* Fixed a rendering issue with sprites on M1 Macs
* Fix caret not showing up in input box
* Lots of type-hint fixes

Version 2.6.1
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

* Removed type annotations which were introduced in Python 3.8 to fix compatibility with Python 3.7 and 3.6
* Fixed flickering on static drawing. See `#858 <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/858>`_

Version 2.6.0
-------------

Version 2.6.0 is a major update to Arcade. It is not 100% backwards compatible with the 2.5 API.
Updates were made to text rendering, tiled map support, sprites, shaders, textures, GUI system,
and the documentation.

* `Tiled Map Editor <https://www.mapeditor.org/>`_ support has been overhauled.

  * Arcade now uses the .json file format for maps created by the Tiled Map Editor rather than the TMX format.
    Tile sets and other supporting files need to all be saved in .json format. The XML based formats are no longer
    supported by Arcade.
  * Arcade now supports a minimum version of Tiled 1.5. Maps saved with an older version of Tiled will likely work
    in most scenarios, but for all features the minimum version we can support is 1.5 due to changes in the Tiled
    map format.
  * Feature-support for Tiled maps has been improved to have near 100% parity with Tiled itself.
  * See :ref:`platformer_tutorial` for a how-to, Tiled usage starts at Chapter 9.
  * See `Community RPG <https://github.com/pythonarcade/community-rpg>`_ or `Community Platformer <https://github.com/pythonarcade/community-platformer>`_ for a more complex example program.

  .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythonarcade/community-rpg/main/screenshot.png
     :width: 50%
     :alt: Screenshot of tile map

* Texture atlases have been introduced, texture management has been improved.

  * A sprite list will create and use its own texture atlas.
  * This introduces a new :class:`arcade.TextureAtlas` class that is used internally by SpriteList.
  * Sprites with new textures can be added to a sprite list without the delay. Arcade 2.5 had a delay caused by rebuilding
    its internal sprite sheet.
  * As a side effect, sprites can only belong to one sprite list that renders.
  * The texture atlas portion of a sprite can be drawn to, and quickly updated on the GPU side.

    * To demonstrate, there is a new :ref:`minimap` example that creates a sprite that has a dynamic minimap
      projected onto it.

    .. image:: ../example_code/how_to_examples/minimap.png
       :width: 50%
       :alt: Screenshot of minimap

* Revamped text rendering done by :func:`arcade.draw_text`.
  Rather than use Pillow to render onto an image, Arcade uses Pyglet's
  text drawing system.
  Text drawing is faster, higher resolution, and not prone to memory leaks. Fonts are now specifed by the
  font name, rather than the file name of the font.

  * Fonts can be dynamically loaded with :func:`arcade.load_font`.
  * Kenney.nl's TTF are now included as build-in resources.
  * See the :ref:`drawing_text` example.

  .. image:: ../example_code/how_to_examples/drawing_text.png
     :width: 50%
     :alt: Screenshot of drawing text

* SpriteList optimizations.

  * Sprites now draw even faster than before. On an Intel i7 with nVidia 980 Ti graphics card,
    8,000+ moving sprites can be drawn while maintaining 60 FPS. The same machine can only
    do 2,000 sprites with Pygame before FPS drops.

* Shadertoy support.

  * `Shadertoy.com <https://www.shadertoy.com/>`_ is a website that makes it easier to write OpenGL shaders.
  * The new :class:`arcade.Shadertoy` class makes it easy to run and interact with these shaders in Arcade.
  * See :ref:`shader_toy_tutorial_glow` and `Asteroids <https://github.com/pythonarcade/asteroids>`_.

  * More documentation (:ref:`gui_concepts`)
  * Available Elements:

    * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIWidget`:

      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIFlatButton` - 2D flat button for simple interactions (hover, press, release, click)
      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UITextureButton` - textured button (use :meth:`arcade.load_texture()`) for simple interactions (hover, press, release, click)
      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UILabel` - Simple text, supports multiline
      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIInputText` - field to accept user text input
      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UITextArea` - Multiline scrollable text widget.
      * :class:`~arcade.gui.UISpriteWidget` - Embeds a Sprite within the GUI tree

    * :class:`~arcade.gui.UILayout`:

        * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIBoxLayout` - Places widgets next to each other (vertical or horizontal)

    * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIWrapper`:

        * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIPadding` - Add space around a widget
        * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIBorder` - Add border around a widget
        * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIAnchorWidget` - Used to position UIWidgets relative on screen

    * Constructs

        * :class:`~arcade.gui.UIMessageBox` - Popup box with a message text and a few buttons.

    * Mixins

        * :class:`~arcade.gui.mixins.UIDraggableMixin` - Makes a widget draggable.
        * :class:`~arcade.gui.mixins.UIMouseFilterMixin` - Catches mouse events that occure within the widget boundaries.
        * :class:`~arcade.gui.mixins.UIWindowLikeMixin` - Combination of :class:`~arcade.gui.mixins.UIDraggableMixin` and :class:`~arcade.gui.UIMouseFilterMixin`.

  * WIP
    * UIWidgets contain information about preferred sizes
    * UILayouts can grow or shrink widgets, to adjust to different screen sizes

* Scene Manager.

  * There is now a new :class:`arcade.Scene` class that can be used to manage SpriteLists and their draw order.
    This can be used in place of having to draw multiple spritelists in your draw function. 
  * Contains special integration with :class:`arcade.TileMap` using :func:`arcade.Scene.from_tilemap` which will
    automatically create an entire scene from a loaded tilemap in the proper draw order.
  * See :ref:`platformer_tutorial` for an introduction to this concept, and it is used heavily throughout that tutorial.

* Camera support

  * Easy scrolling with :class:`arcade.Camera`
  * For an example of this see the example: :ref:`sprite_move_scrolling`.
  * Automatic camera shake can be added in, see the example: :ref:`sprite_move_scrolling_shake`.
  * Several other examples and tutorials make use of this class, like :ref:`platformer_tutorial`.

* Add a set of functions to track performance statistics. See :ref:`perf_info_api`.
* Added the class :class:`arcade.PerfGraph`, a subclass of Sprite that will graph FPS or time to process a dispatch-able
  event line 'update' or 'on_draw'.

  .. image:: ../example_code/how_to_examples/performance_statistics.png
     :width: 50%
     :alt: Screenshot of performance statistics

* Documentation

  * Lots of individual documentation updates for commands.
  * The :ref:`quick_index` has been reorganized to be easier to find commands, and
    the individual API documentation pages have been broken into parts, so it isn't one large monolithic page.
  * New tutorial for :ref:`raycasting_tutorial`.

    .. image:: ../tutorials/raycasting/example.png
       :width: 50%

  * New tutorial for :ref:`shader_toy_tutorial_glow`.
  * Revamped tutorial: :ref:`platformer_tutorial`.
  * Revamped minimap example: :ref:`minimap`.
  * Moved from AWS hosting to read-the-docs hosting so we can support multiple versions of docs.
  * New example showing how to use the new performance statistics API: :ref:`performance_statistics_example`
  * New example: :ref:`gui_widgets`
  * New example: :ref:`gui_flat_button`
  * New example: :ref:`gui_ok_messagebox`

* API commands

   * :func:`arcade.get_pixel` supports getting RGB and RGBA color value
   * :func:`arcade.get_three_color_float` Returns colors as RGB float with numbers 0.0-1.1 for each color
   * :func:`arcade.get_four_color_float`  Returns colors as RGBA float with numbers 0.0-1.1 for each color\

* Better PyInstaller Support

  Previously our PyInstaller hook only fully functioned on Windows, with a bit of functionality on Linux.
  Mac was just completely unsupported and would raise an UnimplementedError if you tried.

  Now we have full out of the box support for PyInstaller with Windows, Mac, and Linux.

  See :ref:`bundle_into_redistributable` for an example of how to use it.

* Sound

  The sound API remains unchanged, however general stability of the sound system has been greatly improved via
  updates to `Pyglet <http://pyglet.org/>`_.

* `Fix for A-star path finding routing through walls <https://github.com/pythonarcade/arcade/issues/806>`_

Special thanks to:

* `einarf <https://github.com/einarf>`_ for performance improvements, texture atlas support, shader toy support,
  text drawing support, advice on GUI, and more.
* `Cleptomania <https://github.com/Cleptomania>`_ for Tiled Map support, sound support, and more.
* `eruvanos <https://github.com/eruvanos>`_ for the original GUI and all the GUI updates.

  `Pyglet <http://pyglet.org/>`_ library we use so much.

Version 2.5.7
-------------

*Released on 2021-May-25*

Fixes
~~~~~

* The arcade gui should now respect the current viewport
* Fixed an issue with UILabel allocating large amounts of
  textures over time consuming a lot of memory
* Fixed an issue with the initial viewport sometimes being
  1 pixel too small causing some artifacts
* Fixed a race condition in ``Sound.stop()`` sometimes
  causing a crash
* Fixed an issue in requirements causing issues for poetry
* Fixed an error reporting issue when reaching maximum
  texture size

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**replit.com**

Arcade should now work out of the box on replit.com. We detect
when arcade runs in replit tweaking various settings. One important
setting we disable is antialiasing since this doesn't work
well with software rendering.

**Alternative Garbage Collection of OpenGL Resources**

``arcade.gl.Context`` now supports an alternative garbage collection mode more
compatible with threaded applications and garbage collection of OpenGL resources.
OpenGL resources can only be accessed or destroyed from the same thread the
window was created. In threaded applications the Python garbage collector
can in some cases try to destroy OpenGL objects possibly causing a hard crash.

This can be configured when creating the ``arcade.Window`` passing in a new
``gc_mode`` parameter. By default this parameter is ``"auto"`` providing
the default garbage collection we have in Python.

Passing in ``"context_gc"`` on the other hand will move all "dead" OpenGL
objects into ``Context.objects``. These can be garbage collected manually
by calling ``Context.gc()`` in a more controlled way in the the right thread.

  advanced OpenGL programming. New API in Arcade Open GL.

    * Support to render to frame buffer, then re-render.
    * Use frame buffers to create a 'glow' or 'bloom' effect: :ref:`bloom_defender`.
    * Use frame-buffers to support lights: :ref:`light_demo`.

Version 2.4 Minor Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**New functions/classes:**

* Added `get_display_size() <arcade.html#arcade.get_display_size>`_ to get
  resolution of the monitor
* Added `Window.center_window() <arcade.html#arcade.Window.center_window>`_ to
  center the window on the monitor.
* Added `has_line_of_sight() <arcade.html#arcade.has_line_of_sight>`_ to
  calculate if there is line-of-sight between two points.
* Added `SpriteSolidColor <arcade.html#arcade.SpriteSolidColor>`_

   :width: 75%

   hit_box_algorithm = "Detailed"


Version 2.4 Under-the-hood improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**General**

* Simple Physics engine is less likely to 'glitch' out.
* Anti-aliasing should now work on windows if ``antialiasing=True``
  is passed in the window constructor.
* Major speed improvements to drawing of shape primitives, such as lines, squares,
  and circles by moving more of the work to the graphics processor.
* Speed improvements for sprites including gpu-based sprite culling (don't draw sprites outside the screen).
* Speed improvements due to shader caching. This should be especially noticeable on Mac OS.
* Speed improvements due to more efficient ways of setting rendering states such as projection.
* Speed improvements due to less memory copying in the lower level rendering API.

**OpenGL API**

A brand new low level rendering API wrapping OpenGL 3.3 core was added in this release.
It's loosely based on the `ModernGL <https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl>`_ API,
so ModernGL users should be able to pick it up fast.
This API is used by arcade for all the higher level drawing functionality, but
can also be used by end users to really take advantage of their GPU. More
guides and tutorials around this is likely to appear in the future.

A simplified list of features in the new API:

* A :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Context` and :py:class:`arcade.ArcadeContext` object was
  introduced and can be found through the ``window.ctx`` property.
  This object offers methods to create opengl resources such as textures,
  programs/shaders, framebuffers, buffers and queries. It also has shortcuts for changing
  various context states. When working with OpenGL in arcade you are encouraged to use
  ``arcade.gl`` instead of ``pyglet.gl``. This is important as the context is doing
  quite a bit of bookkeeping to make our life easier.
* New :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Texture` class supporting a wide variety of formats such as 8/16/32 bit
  integer, unsigned integer and float values. New convenient methods and properties
  was also added to change filtering, repeat mode, read and write data, building mipmaps etc.
* New :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Buffer` class with methods for manipulating data such as
  simple reading/writing and copying data from other buffers. This buffer can also
  now be bound as a uniform buffer object.
* New :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Framebuffer` wrapper class making us able to render any content into
  one more more textures. This opens up for a lot of possibilities.
* The :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Program` has been expanded to support geometry shaders and transform feedback
  (rendering to a buffer instead of a screen). It also exposes a lot of new
  properties due to much more details introspection during creation.
  We also able to assign binding locations for uniform blocks.
* A simple glsl wrapper/parser was introduced to sanity check the glsl code,
  inject preprocessor values and auto detect out attributes (used in transforms).
* A higher level type :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Geometry` was introduced to make working with
  shaders/programs a lot easier. It supports using a subset of attributes
  defined in your buffer description by inspecting the the program's attributes
  generating and caching compatible variants internally.
* A :py:class:`~arcade.gl.Query` class was added for easy access to low level
  measuring of opengl rendering calls. We can get the number samples written,
  number of primitives processed and time elapsed in nanoseconds.
* Added support for the buffer protocol. When ``arcade.gl`` requires byte data
  we can also pass objects like numpy array of pythons ``array.array`` directly
  not having to convert this data to bytes.

Version 2.4 New Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New Tutorial: :ref:`pymunk_platformer_tutorial`
* New Tutorial: :ref:`view-tutorial`
