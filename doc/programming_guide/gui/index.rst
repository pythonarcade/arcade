GUI
===


Arcade's GUI module provides you classes to interact with the user using buttons, labels and much more.

Behind the scenes the GUI uses a different rendering system than the rest of the engine.
The GUI is especially designed to allow resizing and scaling of the widgets,
which can cause problems with the normal rendering system.

Usage examples are listed under :ref:`gui_examples_overview`.

We recommend to read the :ref:`gui_concepts`, to get a better understanding of the
GUI module and its components.
