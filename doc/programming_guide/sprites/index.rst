Drawing & Using Sprites
=======================

Most games built with Arcade will use sprites and sprite lists to draw image
data. This section of the programming guide will help you achieve that by
covering:

* What sprites & sprite lists are
* The essentials of how to use them
* How to get started with images
* Non-drawing features such as collisions
* Overviews of various advanced techniques

Beginners should start by reading & following :ref:`pg_spritelists` page
(~10 minute read). If you get stuck, see :ref:`how-to-get-help`.
