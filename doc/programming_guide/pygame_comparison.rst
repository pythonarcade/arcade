Pygame Comparison
=================

Both Pygame and Arcade are Python libraries for making it easy to create 2D games.
Pygame is raster-graphics based. It is very fast at manipulating individual pixels and can run on almost
anything.
Arcade uses OpenGL. It is very fast at drawing sprites and off-loads functions such as rotation
and transparency to the graphics card.

Here are some comparisons between Arcade 2.6 and Pygame 2.0.1:

    FPS comparison of programs drawing **stationary** sprites.

.. figure:: images/fps_comparison1.svg

    FPS comparison of programs drawing **moving** sprites.

.. [#f1] To support rotation and/or scaling, PyGame programs must write the image to a surface, transform the surface,
         then create a sprite out of the surface. This takes a lot of CPU. Arcade off-loads all these operations to the
         graphics card.
.. [#f2] When creating a sprite from an image, Pygame will load the image from the disk every time. The user must
         cache the image with their own code for better performance. Arcade does this automatically.
.. [#f5] A programmer can achieve a similar result by drawing to a surface, then drawing the surface to the screen.
.. [#f6] Performance tests done on an Intel Core i7-9700F with GeForce GTX 980 Ti. Source code for tests available at
         https://github.com/pythonarcade/performance_tests and more detailed results at
         https://craven-performance-testing.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html
.. [#f3] Polygon hit box, rotation allowed
.. [#f4] Rectangular hit box, no rotation allowed
.. [#f7] Why is Arcade so slow here? With PyGame, most of the drawing is done on the **CPU** side. Bitmaps
         are created and manipulated by the CPU. It is pretty fast. With Arcade, most of the drawing happens
         on the **GPU** side. Sprites and drawings are batched together, and we just tell the GPU what we want
         to change. Or better yet, we write a "shader" program that runs completely on the GPU.
         This is *incredibly* fast. But
         if instead a CPU program runs commands to draw individual GPU items one-by-one, both sets
         of processors wait for a synchronous communication.
         That is horribly slow. Drawing individual rects and bits like
         PyGame does, won't work well at all on Arcade. Use sprites, shaders, or batch-drawing to
         get fast performance.
.. [#f8] Scaling and rotation must be done by the programmer drawing to a surface, transforming the surface,
         then blit'ing the surface to the screen. Arcade uses the GPU for these operations and needs no
         additional code or performance hits.
