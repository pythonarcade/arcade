Installation
------------
Arcade can be installed like any other Python
Package. Arcade needs support for OpenGL 3.3+. It does not run on Raspberry
Pi or Wayland.
If you are familiar with Python package management you can just
"pip install" Arcade.
For more detailed instructions see :ref:`installation-instructions`.

Getting Help
------------

If you get stuck, you can always ask for help! See the page on
:ref:`how-to-get-help` for more information.

Starting Tutorials
------------------

If you are already familiar with basic Python programming, follow the
:ref:`platformer_tutorial` or
`Real Python article <https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/>`_.
If you are just learning how to program, see
the `Learn Arcade book <https://learn.arcade.academy>`_.
