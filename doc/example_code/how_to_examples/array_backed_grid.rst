If you work with grids much, you'll find this to be slow. You may want to look
at:

* :ref:`array_backed_grid_buffered` - faster and uses buffered shapes
* :ref:`array_backed_grid_sprites_1` - super-fast and uses sprites. Resyncs to number grid in one function call
* :ref:`array_backed_grid_sprites_2` super-fast and uses sprites. Keeps a second 2D grid of sprites to match 2D grid of numbers
