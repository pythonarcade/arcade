Have Enemies Periodically Shoot
===============================

Having enemies shoot every *x* seconds is a bit more complex than shooting
randomly as shown in :ref:`sprite_bullets_random`. This is because we need
to track how often we shoot, and how long it has been since we last shot.

This example uses custom sub-class ``EnemySprite``. The extra attributes allow
us to track the periodic timing. See the highlighted lines for what is specific
to this example.
