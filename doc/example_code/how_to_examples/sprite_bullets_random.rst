Have Enemies Randomly Shoot
===========================

Having enemies randomly shoot is easier than periodically shooting enemies as shown
in :ref:`sprite_bullets_periodic`. This is because we don't have to track how
long it has been since we last fired.

See the highlighted lines for what is specific to this example.
