--------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/array_backed_grid.png

Source: :ref:`array_backed_grid`

This example demonstrates the use of a two-dimensional list or array (also known as a matrix) to create a visual grid on the screen application using the Python Arcade library. The code defines a grid with a certain number of rows and columns, each of a specific width and height. Each cell in the grid is represented by a number in the array, and these numbers can be updated to change the color of the corresponding cell. Mouse clicks on the screen are translated into cell coordinates so that the user can interact with individual cells. This mechanism can be used to build more complex visual applications like game boards or pixel art editors. The grid is drawn on the screen using Arcade's drawing functions, specifically, rectangles are used to represent cells.

array_backed_grid_buffered.py
-----------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/array_backed_grid_buffered.png

Source: :ref:`array_backed_grid_buffered`

This piece of Python code demonstrates the use of a 2-dimensional grid backed by a list of lists to represent and visualize grid-based information on screen using the Arcade library. The example creates a grid of cells where each cell can be toggled between two colors (white or green) by clicking on it. The code does this by maintaining a list of lists, where each element in the inner list corresponds to a grid cell and has a value of either 0 (white) or 1 (green). The example also computes the screen size required to display the grid with cells of given widths and heights, along with specified margins. Using Arcade's shape list, grid cells are drawn on the screen as rectangles of appropriate colors based on their values in the underlying 2D list. The code also handles mouse click events, converting screen coordinates into grid coordinates, toggling the value of the clicked grid cell, and rebuilding the shape list to update the grid display.

array_backed_grid_sprites_1.py
------------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/array_backed_grid_sprites_1.png

Source: :ref:`array_backed_grid_sprites_1`

This example demonstrates how to use a two-dimensional list or array to represent and manipulate the display of a grid on-screen using the Arcade library in Python. It creates a grid using a 2D list, where each cell can have a value of either 0 or 1, representing a white or green cell, respectively. The example then syncs the grid with a sprite list using the `resync_grid_with_sprites` method. This is a more efficient approach compared to rebuilding a shape list for every grid update. However, this implementation still requires inspecting every cell when the grid updates, which might be slow for large grids. The code also demonstrates how to handle user clicks on the grid and change cell values based on the click, updating the sprite colors to match the updated grid.

----------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/background_blending.png

Source: :ref:`background_blending`

The provided Python code using the Arcade library is an example of background blending in a game scenario. This technique involves loading and managing two scrolling game backgrounds, and automatically transitioning or blending between the two when the player sprite reaches a specific position on the x-axis. The blending effect is controlled with blend_layer method. The game player's movements are managed with keyboard inputs, and a simple camera system is used to ensure the rendered view always centers on the Player Sprite. The code also includes logic to manage window resizing, ensuring an adequate background coverage for different screen sizes.

background_groups.py
--------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/background_groups.png

Source: :ref:`background_groups`

The given Python code using the Arcade library demonstrates the use of background groups and simple cameras in creating a game. The code defines a game window class and specifies properties such as screen height, width, and title. It also sets up player controls for motion. The primary concept this code highlights is how to handle multiple background images, allowing them to be drawn with a single draw call and move or scroll together as a group. It also demonstrates how to utilize a simple camera to keep the player in view, panning as needed to follow the playerï¿½s movements.

background_parallax.py
----------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/background_parallax.png

Source: :ref:`background_parallax`

This example demonstrates the use of parallax scrolling in the Arcade library to create a visually appealing, seemingly endless background for a 2D game. Parallax scrolling is a technique where multiple layers of images move at different speeds, creating an illusion of depth and a more immersive experience for the player. The Arcade library provides the ParallaxGroup class to easily implement this technique. In this example, a car moves horizontally across a background consisting of four layers - sky, buildings, palms, and a highway - each moving at a different depth, giving the illusion of distance. The SimpleCamera class in Arcade neatly encapsulates the camera's position, allowing for the seamless tracking and panning of the player's car across the screen. When resized, the background ensures it still occupies the full width of the new screen size.

background_scrolling.py
-----------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/background_scrolling.png

Source: :ref:`background_scrolling`

The given code demonstrates the implementation of a scrolling background using the Arcade library in Python. It utilizes the Arcade.experimental.background module to create a screen-sized background texture that is constantly aligned to the camera viewport and changes its texture offset, giving the illusion of movement. The example code also includes a player sprite that the user can control with arrow keys, and the camera is smoothly panned to keep the player at the center of the screen. The scrolling background is achieved by updating the background's position and texture offset to stay in sync with the camera position. This concept and technique can be particularly useful in creating side-scrolling or top-down video games that involve continuous movement through a large environment.

background_stationary.py
------------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/background_stationary.png

Source: :ref:`background_stationary`

The 'MyGame' class then sets up and manages the game, with functions for initializing, setting up the game, rendering the display, handling key-press events, panning the camera view for a scrolling effect, and updating the game state. Key features include loading a tile map, creating and controlling a player sprite, implementing game physics, collision detection with coins and bombs, and a constantly updating score count. It also includes a game over condition when the player reaches the end of the map. Furthermore, camera movement is managed to create an effect of scrolling viewport, maintaining the player sprite in view during gameplay. The concept of 'Frames per Second' (FPS) is demonstrated by repeatedly calculating and displaying the FPS. This case also includes the creation and utilization of cameras to handle the viewport, and how to shake the camera upon specific events like hitting a bomb.

conway_alpha.py
---------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/conway_alpha.png

Source: :ref:`conway_alpha`

This piece of Python code illustrates how to create and manipulate a grid of sprites using the Arcade library. It's an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The code sets up a grid of sprites, using a two-dimensional list for grid access and a one-dimensional list for drawing. The 'alpha' value of the sprites is used to toggle them 'on' or 'off', simulating live and dead cells in the Game of Life. The game follows a set of rules to decide on the state of a cell in the next generation, based on its current state and the states of its neighboring cells. Each cell in the grid is a sprite that can either be 'alive' (visible) or 'dead' (invisible), thus creating an interactive visual representation of Conway's Game of Life. The simulation updates and displays the grid with each new generation of cells.

It depicts the creation of a dual-stick shooter game where players can use either a game controller, if present, or keyboard controls. The game involves a player sprite that moves and shoots at spawning enemy sprites, scoring points for each enemy defeated. The player sprite's movement and shooting directions are managed either by the controller or keyboard inputs. If an enemy reaches the player sprite, the game is over. The example employs a variety of concepts such as object-oriented programming (creation of Player, Enemy, and Game classes), usage of internal library functions for sprite list creation, collision detection, scheduled tasks, keyboard and controller input mapping, and rendering game visuals.

easing_example_1.py
-------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/easing_example_1.png

Source: :ref:`easing_example_1`

The given Python code explains the utilization of easing functions for positioning using the Arcade library. Easing functions are used to give a dynamic or 'animation-like' motion to a static object in programming. It does not simply move the object from one point to another but adds a bit of realism to its movement by accelerating and decelerating it. The example also shows how to use easing for angles. It covers various easing types like linear, ease out, ease in, smoothstep, ease in/out, ease out elastic, ease in back, and many more. These easing types decide the speed of the object at different instances producing various motion effects. This script displays balls moving across the screen using these different types of easings to illustrate their effects and compare them visually.

easing_example_2.py
-------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/easing_example_2.png

Source: :ref:`easing_example_2`

This example demonstrates the use of easing functions in the Arcade library to create smooth animations for position and angles. Easing functions provide a way to interpolate between two points or angles, which allows for gradual changes in position or angle over time. The code includes a `Player` class that has methods for updating the sprite's angle and position using different easing functions, and a `MyGame` class that implements the game window and user input. When a user presses numbered keys from 1 to 9, the example demonstrates different easing functions such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, and smoothstep for both angle and position. This helps to understand how different easing functions can affect the game object's motion and rotation, creating more visually appealing and varied animations.

follow_path.py
--------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/follow_path.png

Source: :ref:`follow_path`

This example demonstrates how to create a sprite, specifically an enemy sprite, that follows a predetermined path in a game using the Arcade library. It defines an `Enemy` class that inherits from the `arcade.Sprite` class and implements an update function to control the sprite's movements along a specified list of positions. The path is determined by a list of (x, y) coordinates, and the sprite's speed is also taken into account to ensure smooth transitions between path points. The sprite calculates the angle and distance to the next point in its path and uses trigonometry functions to update its position accordingly. When the sprite reaches the end of the path, it loops back to the beginning. In this particular example, the player sprite follows the mouse cursor, and a robot enemy sprite moves along a square-shaped path.

full_screen_example.py

Additionally, it allows the user to toggle the profiling tools on and off using the space key.

perspective.py
--------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/perspective.png

Source: :ref:`perspective`

This example demonstrates the use of perspective projection and shaders to create a 3D effect in an Arcade game. The code creates a virtual framebuffer for off-screen rendering, maps the content onto a texture, and rotates the texture in 3D space using perspective projection. A simple texture shader is used to project and model the matrix, as well as scroll texture coordinates. The example code sets up a geometry buffer for a textured plane and adds sprites to the scene. The on_draw() method updates the offscreen texture, clears the window, applies transformations to the plane's position and rotation, and scrolls the texture coordinates. Finally, the draw_offscreen() method renders the sprites into the framebuffer's texture, and the on_resize() method updates the perspective projection as needed. This technique can be used to create 3D backgrounds or other visual elements in a 2D Arcade game.

The game consists of a player character that can move around a screen with a boundary of walls, push a set of rocks and gems, and shoot bullets. The bullets have different attributes such as mass, damping, friction, elasticity, and collision effect). The game world has variable damping and friction for all objects, which control how objects slow down over time. The player's movement is controlled through keyboard inputs, where a force is applied to the player's character in the direction of the key pressed. The example also includes collision handlers for when a bullet hits a rock or wall. The physics engine takes care of all the movement, forces, and collision calculations, making it easier to develop complex physical interactions in the game world.

Source: :ref:`pymunk_pegboard`

This Python code provides an example of how to utilize the Arcade library and the Pymunk physics engine together to create a dynamic and interactive simulation. The application displays a grid of static circles (similar to a pegboard), and constantly drops balls at random horizontal positions from the top of the screen. The balls are subject to gravity and bounce off the static circles, the floor, and the walls on the sides. The class `CircleSprite` is used to couple a graphical representation (or sprite) from the Arcade library with a physical body from the Pymunk engine. All the balls and pegs are instances of this class. The main game class `MyGame` includes methods for updating the physics, drawing all the objects on screen, and handling events. This explains how to combine the 2D graphics of the Arcade library with the physical simulations of the Pymunk engine, providing an example of how to implement a more realistic and interactive game or display. The code also demonstrates how to time different events and how to manage and update different game components.

Source: :ref:`radar_sweep`

The given Python code demonstrates a radar sweep animation using the Arcade library. It creates a simulation of a radar screen with a rotating sweep line and a circular outline to represent the radar's range. The Radar class contains an update method to adjust the angle of the sweep line and a draw method to render the line and circular outline on the screen. The MyGame class inherits from arcade.Window to create a window with custom dimensions and title, and it overrides the on_update and on_draw methods to update and draw the radar sweep, respectively. The main function initializes the MyGame class and starts the animation by calling arcade.run(). This example provides a visually appealing way to understand trigonometry in motion, specifically the use of sine and cosine functions to move an object in a circular path.

The code defines an "on_resize" method to achieve this; this method is automatically called whenever the game window is resized, updating the window dimensions accordingly. Besides that, the "on_draw" method is overridden to customize the drawing/display on the window: it draws x and y labels at regular intervals along the two axes. When run, the snippet creates an instance of this game window with the specific screen width, screen height, and screen title, and the Arcade game engine is run.

sections_demo_1.py
------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/sections_demo_1.png

Source: :ref:`sections_demo_1`

The python code demonstrates how to create and manage sections of a screen using the Arcade library. It creates a window which is divided into two sections (left and right). Each section is designated with a certain color and action. The "Box" class represents an object in each section. The "ScreenPart" class represents a section of the screen, it can handle its own events (such as mouse clicking, dragging, entering, and leaving). It also updates and draws the section and the box object in it. The "GameView" class manages the view of the game -- it initializes the game window, divides the window into 2 sections, and draws a line separating these sections. The code shows the encapsulation of game logic within individual classes, and how each class handles its events independently, making the code modular and easy to maintain.

Source: :ref:`shape_list_demo_3`

The given Python code illustrates the concept of using buffer to improve the performance of rendering in Arcade library. It creates a grid of square shapes and draws them on the screen using a single draw call, instead of performing multiple draw commands for each square. The square shapes along with their properties such as color and position coordinates are stored in a shape list. When it comes to rendering these squares, all are drawn in one go using the `shape_list.draw()` method, improving the speed and efficiency of the rendering process. The `timeit` module is used to keep track of the time taken for each frame to render. Consideration for the order of the points as well as color gradients is also taken into account. This technique can significantly increase the performance when working with many objects that need to be rendered simultaneously.

The "on_update" method accumulates total time and converts this time into minutes, seconds, and hundreds of seconds using division and modulus operations, displaying the time on-screen with string formatting. Every frame, the timer's time updates, and the timer text is redrawn with its new time. This example could be used in a game where time tracking is necessary, such as a speed-run game or countdown timer.

transform_feedback.py
---------------------
.. image:: how_to_examples/transform_feedback.png

Source: :ref:`transform_feedback`

The given Python code is an illustration of a concept known as Transform Feedback in the context of a graphics rendering pipeline in Arcade game library. In this case, it implements a basic physical simulation where a group of points behave under a pseudo gravitational force. Transform feedback mainly allows the output of vertex shader operations to be captured in buffer objects. This approach can be extensively used for implementing simulations, complex animations, and procedural geometry as it permits processing of the original geometry to output new geometry. In this example, a gravity shader simulates the effect of gravity on a set of randomly initialized points. The positions and velocities of these points are stored in two buffers and the gravity program updates these values following gravity simulation. This technique of updating between two buffers is often referred to as 'ping-ponging'. The render process visualizes the points in updated positions. The buffers are swapped at the end of each frame, yielding a perpetual update and render cycle with real-time motion of points under gravity.

It does this by defining separate classes for each screen or view in the game, such as "MenuView," "GameView," and "PauseView", which inherit from the arcade.View class. Each view class has its own draw, update, and window event methods. Switching between views is done by creating a view instance and using the "self.window.show_view(view)" method. The example showcases a game with a moving sprite that can be paused and resumed using the Escape key without losing the sprite position and with the possibility to return to the main menu and restart the game.

This example demonstrates how to use the Arcade library to display a sequence of screens in a game by utilizing the 'arcade.View' class. Each screen is managed by a separate class that inherits from 'arcade.View', and has its own draw, update, and window event methods. These views can be easily switched by creating a new view object and setting it with the 'self.window.set_view(view)' method. The example includes a menu screen, a game screen, and a game over screen, each with their own user input events and background colors. This approach makes it simpler to organize and manage screen-specific code and data in the game development process.
