Installation
------------
Arcade can be installed like any other Python
Package. Arcade needs support for OpenGL 3.3+.
If you are familiar with Python package management you can just
"pip install" Arcade.
For more detailed instructions see :ref:`installation-instructions`.

Getting Help
------------

If you get stuck, you can always ask for help! See the page on
:ref:`how-to-get-help` for more information.

Tutorials
---------

If you are already familiar with basic Python programming, follow the
:ref:`platformer_tutorial` as a quick way to get up and running.
If you are just learning how to program, see
the `Learn Arcade book <https://learn.arcade.academy>`_.
