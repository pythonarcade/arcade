class Clock:
    """
    A time keeping class which provides a method for easily tracking the
    elapsed time, delta_time, and number of ticks.

    Arcade provides a global clock which is automatically ticked by the window.

    *Coming post 3.0:*
    you can add 'sub-clocks' to Arcade's top level clock which will tick at the
    same time, and have cumulative tick_speeds. This allows you to slow down
    only certain elements rather than everything.

    Args:
        initial_elapsed: The amount of time the clock should assume has
            already occurred. Defaults to 0.0
        initial_tick: The number of ticks the clock should assume has already
            occurred. Defaults to 0.
        tick_speed: A multiplier on how the 'speed' of time.
            i.e. a value of 0.5 means time elapsed half as fast for this clock. Defaults to 1.0.
