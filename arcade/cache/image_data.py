    of this cache. We want to obtain and image based on a value that
    can be constructed without knowing the pixel data.

    The reasoning for caching the ImageData object instead of the
    PIL.Image object is to avoid re-calculating the hash in addition
    to eliminating the need to load it and convert the pixel format.
