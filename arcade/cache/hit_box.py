"""
A simple cache for hit boxes calculated from texture.
Hit box calculations are normally done at load time
by inspecting the contents of a loaded image.

Depending on the hit box algorithm a hit box is calculated:
* None     : Simply a box around the whole texture. No caching needed.
* Simple   : Scanning the corners for the texture
* Detailed : fairly detailed hit box generated by pymunk with detail parameter
