    The creation of a texture is an expensive operation for several reasons.
    * Loading an image from disk has a cost
    * Converting the image to a format suitable for OpenGL has a cost
    * Calculating the hash of the image has a cost
    * Creating the texture instance has a cost
    * Once the texture is created it's expensive to calculate hit box points

    This cache is intended to reduce the cost of creating textures by reusing
    existing ones. We also re-use the internal images on the existing textures
    for making different configurations of the same texture such as flipped
    and rotated versions including textures with different hit box configurations
    for the same image.
