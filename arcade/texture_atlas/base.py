"""
Texture Atlas for SpriteList

The long term goal is to rely on pyglet's texture atlas, but
it's still unclear what features we need supported in arcade
so need to prototype something to get started.

We're still building on pyglet's allocator.

Pyglet atlases are located here:
https://github.com/einarf/pyglet/blob/master/pyglet/image/atlas.py

Allocation:
Pyglet's allocator is a simple row based allocator only keeping
track of horizontal strips and how far in the x direction the
each strip is filled. We can't really "deallocate" unless it's
a region at the end of a strip and even doing that is awkward.

When an image is removed from the atlas we simply just lose that
region until we rebuild the atlas. It can be a good idea to count
the number of lost regions to use as an indicator later. When an
atlas is full we can first rebuild it if there are lost regions
instead of increasing the size.
