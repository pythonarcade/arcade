    A texture atlas using bindless textures. This is an extension to OpenGL 4.3+
    and requires the ARB_bindless_texture extension or possibly vendor specific ones.

    Bindless textures are simply 64 bit integer names/handles for a texture that
    can be casted to a sampler in a shader meaning that you can have an unlimited
    amount of samplers in the same draw call. Likely a shader storage buffer is
    needed to store the handles.

    The max capacity is only limited by memory. Discrete GPUs support this
    feature and some igpus AMD igpus from 2019 and later + Intel Xe if
    latest drivers are installed.
