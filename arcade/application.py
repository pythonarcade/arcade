    A window that will appear on your desktop.

    This class is a subclass of Pyglet's Window class with many
    Arcade-specific features added.

    .. note::

        Arcade currently cannot easily support multiple windows. If you need
        multiple windows, consider using multiple views or divide the window
        into sections.

    ..  https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming_guide/windowing.html#window-style

    Args:
        width (int, optional): Window width. Defaults to 1280.
        height (int, optional): Window height. Defaults to 720.
        title (str, optional): The title/caption of the window
        fullscreen (bool, optional): Should this be full screen?
        resizable (bool, optional): Can the user resize the window?
        update_rate (float, optional): How frequently to run the on_update event.
        draw_rate (float, optional): How frequently to run the on_draw event.
            (this is the FPS limit)
        fixed_rate (float, optional): How frequently should the fixed_updates run,
            fixed updates will always run at this rate.
        fixed_frame_cap (float, optional): The maximum number of fixed updates that
            can occur in one update loop.defaults to infinite. If large lag spikes
            cause your game to freeze, try setting this to a smaller number. This
            may cause your physics to lag behind temporarily.
        antialiasing (bool, optional): Use multisampling framebuffer (antialiasing)
        samples (int): Number of samples used in antialiasing (default 4).
            Usually this is 2, 4, 8 or 16.
        gl_version (tuple[int, int], optional): What OpenGL version to request.
            This is ``(3, 3)`` by default and can be overridden when using more
            advanced OpenGL features.
        screen (optional): Pass a pyglet :py:class:`~pyglet.display.Screen` to
            request the window be placed on it. See `pyglet's window size &
            position guide <pyglet_pg_window_size_position_>`_ to learn more.
        style (optional): Request a non-default window style, such as borderless.
            Some styles only work in certain situations. See `pyglet's guide
            to window style <pyglet_pg_window_style_>`_ to learn more.
        visible (bool, optional): Should the window be visible immediately
        vsync (bool, optional): Wait for vertical screen refresh before swapping buffer
            This can make animations and movement look smoother.
        gc_mode (str, optional): Decides how OpenGL objects should be garbage collected
            ("context_gc" (default) or "auto")
        center_window (bool, optional): If true, will center the window.
        enable_polling (bool, optional): Enabled input polling capability.
            This makes the :py:attr:`keyboard` and :py:attr:`mouse` attributes available for use.

    Raises:
        NoOpenGLException: If the system does not support OpenGL requested OpenGL version.
