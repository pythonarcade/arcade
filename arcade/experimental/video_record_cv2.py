"""
Simple video recorder with cv2.
Records Arcade screen to a video file, with minimal
I/O operations and minimal memory usage.

We read pixels directly from OpenGL framebuffer, then into
a NumPy array that we can hand to OpenCV for the video writing.

The other ways of doing this with built-in arcade.get_image()
function would require either a lot of re-processing of images
on CPU for no real reason, saving/reloading each frame as an image file,
or having rampant memory usage problems.

This attempts to have optimal performance while not increasing memory usage
by having as few steps in between the pixel data in VRAM and the final video
file as possible.

Dependencies:
    pip install opencv-python numpy
