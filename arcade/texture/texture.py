        This function has multiple uses, including:

            - Allocating space in texture atlases
            - Generating custom cached textures from component images

        The internal image can be altered with Pillow draw commands and
        then written/updated to a texture atlas. This works best for
        infrequent changes such as generating custom cached sprites.
        For frequent texture changes, you should instead render directly
        into the texture atlas.

        .. warning::

           If you plan to alter images using Pillow, read its
           documentation thoroughly! Some of the functions can have
           unexpected behavior.

           For example, if you want to draw one or more images that
           contain transparency onto a base image that also contains
           transparency, you will likely need to use
           `PIL.Image.alpha_composite`_ as part of your solution.
           Otherwise, blending may behave in unexpected ways.

           This is especially important for customizable characters.

        .. _PIL.Image.alpha_composite: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\
                                       reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.alpha_composite

        Be careful of your RAM usage when using this function. The
        Texture this method returns will have a new internal RGBA
        Pillow image which uses 4 bytes for every pixel in it.
        This will quickly add up if you create many large Textures.

        If you want to create more than one blank texture with the same
        dimensions, you can save CPU time and RAM by calling this
        function once, then passing the ``image`` attribute of the
        resulting Texture object to the class constructor for each
        additional blank Texture instance you would like to create.
        This can be especially helpful if you are creating multiple
        large Textures.
