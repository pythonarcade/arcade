    Attempt to load an animated GIF as a :class:`TextureAnimationSprite`.

    .. note::

        Many older GIFs will load with incorrect transparency for every
        frame but the first. Until the Pillow library handles the quirks of
        the format better, loading animated GIFs will be pretty buggy. A
        good workaround is loading GIFs in another program and exporting them
        as PNGs, either as sprite sheets or a frame per file.

    Args:
        resource_name: A path to a GIF as either a :py:class:`pathlib.Path`
            or a :py:class:`str` which may include a
