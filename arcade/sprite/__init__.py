    Attempt to load an animated GIF as an :class:`TextureAnimationSprite`.

    Many older GIFs will load with incorrect transparency for every

    the format better, loading animated GIFs will be pretty buggy. A
    good workaround is loading GIFs in another program and exporting them
    as PNGs, either as sprite sheets or a frame per file.
