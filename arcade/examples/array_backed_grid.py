"""
Array Backed Grid

Show how to use a two-dimensional list/array to back the display of a
grid on-screen.

Note: Regular drawing commands are slow. Particularly when drawing a lot of
items, like the rectangles in this example.

For faster drawing, create the shapes and then draw them as a batch.
See array_backed_grid_buffered.py

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.array_backed_grid
