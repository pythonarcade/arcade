"""
Shows how we can use shaders using existing spritelist data.

This example builds on previous examples visualizing selection
of nearby sprites taking line of sight into consideration.

This version on the other hand does not visualize. We want
return useful data from the shader to resolve the actual
selected sprite objects so we can use it in our game logic.

For this to happen we need to change our shader into a
transform shader. These shaders do not draw to the screen.
They write data into a buffer we can read back on the
python side. This simply involves removing the fragment
shader and instead defining some values to output.
We also need to do a transform() instead of render()
and supply a buffer for our results. In addition we
use a Query to count how many results the shader gave us.

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.gl.spritelist_interaction_visualize_dist_los_trans
