"""
Example "Arcade" library code.

This example shows how to use functions to draw a scene.
It does not assume that the programmer knows how to use classes yet.

A video walk-through of this code is available at:
https://vimeo.com/167296062

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.drawing_with_functions
