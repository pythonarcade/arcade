"""
Array Backed Grid

Show how to use a two-dimensional list/array to back the display of a
grid on-screen. We can click each cell in the window to toggle the color
or each individual cell.

This is not the most efficient way to maintain an updated grid
simply because we have to rebuild the shape list from scratch
every time it changes, but it's fast enough for smaller grids
that don't update frequently.

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.array_backed_grid_buffered
