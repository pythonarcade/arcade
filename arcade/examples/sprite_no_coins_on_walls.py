No coins on the walls

Simple program to show basic sprite usage. Specifically, create coin sprites that
aren't on top of any walls, and don't have coins on top of each other.

Artwork from http://kenney.nl

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.sprite_no_coins_on_walls
