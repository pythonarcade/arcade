Move Sprite With Keyboard

Simple program to show moving a sprite with the keyboard.
The sprite_move_keyboard_better.py example is slightly better
in how it works, but also slightly more complex.

Artwork from http://kenney.nl

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.sprite_move_keyboard
