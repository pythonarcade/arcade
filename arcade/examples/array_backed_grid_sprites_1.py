"""
Array Backed Grid Shown By Sprites

Show how to use a two-dimensional list/array to back the display of a
grid on-screen.

This version syncs the grid to the sprite list in one go using resync_grid_with_sprites.
This is faster than rebuilding a shape list every time the grid changes,
but we are still inspecting every single cell of the grid when it updates.
There are faster ways, but this works for smaller grid sizes.

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.array_backed_grid_sprites_1
