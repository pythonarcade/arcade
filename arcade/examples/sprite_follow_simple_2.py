Sprite Follow Player 2

This calculates a 'vector' towards the player and randomly updates it based
on the player's location. This is a bit more complex, but more interesting
way of following the player.

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.sprite_follow_simple_2
