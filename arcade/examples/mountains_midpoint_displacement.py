Mountains Midpoint Displacement

Create a random mountain range.
Original idea and some code from:
https://bitesofcode.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/landscape-generation-using-midpoint-displacement/

If Python and Arcade are installed, this example can be run from the command line with:
python -m arcade.examples.mountains_midpoint_displacement
